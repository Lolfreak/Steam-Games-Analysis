## Background
- As an avid fan of video games, we as a team decided to find out whether we are able to find out whether single-player or multi-player games are more popular using various variables.
## Problem Definition
- Are we able to predict if a multi-player or single-player steam game is popular based on its attributes? (how popular is based on its average playtime using separate single-player and multi-player dataset)
- Which model is used to be the best to predict it?
## Models Used
- Test
## Conclusion
- test
## Lessons Learned
- Learn how to use regex (Regular Expression) to allow us to remove certain words on a string
