## Background
- With a high number of active users on Steam, what can businesses and game companies do to leverage on this platform by learning about the trends in gaming. This leads to our problem definition.
## Problem Definition
- We would to like to find out what makes a video game (on steam) popular.
- Which model is used to be the best to predict it?
## Models Used
- Random Forest Classifier - An ensemble learning method for classification and regression
- XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) - Distributed Gradient-Boosted Decision Tree
- AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) - Boosting technique that uses statistical classification meta-algorithm
## Conclusion
- We would recommend businesses and investors to work on new games that are able to satisfy these 3 factors, the game has to be a multiplayer game, the game has to provide or have a community workshop and also have trading cards. These will ensure that the new game will have all the popular factors which attracts gamers. This will exponentially increase the chance on making the next popular game. 
## Lessons Learned
- Learn how to use regex (Regular Expression) to allow us to remove certain words on a string
